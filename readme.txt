You might want to also download scripts for the core and compile them
Debug with win32-debug build
User x64-release for live usage

Arcemu is a lightweight wow server. I think 15 minutes from download to usage. No external dependencies. C like spell scripts...
Right now this core should be in a decent state. It has deathwing scripted for example.

if you do everything right, it should look like something like this : https://mega.co.nz/#!RNJnHRrJ!Tqmr3hgXOjyusBeZhVDxGN4QDsDtJOFgGfx3uF0gdUw

If you ever plan to work on this core, my only request is that you will make some effort to work as a group with other members instead create 1001 new projects that will slowly die out 1 by 1
